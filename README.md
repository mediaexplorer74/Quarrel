# Quarrel v21.0.11 - uwp branch
My fork of Quarrel project for my own micro-research (Goal: some lite version of Quarrel for W10M).

## About
This is "Quarrel V21" (codename):
- A discord client for the Universal Windows Platform.  
- Token auth support realized.

## Screenshots

## Tech details
- Os Win. build (target) set at (to) 19041.
- Min. Win. Os win build (target) set at (to) 15063.
- iPhone SE LoginPage "emulation" added (old sweet user-agent "mechanics" used), but not operational, sadly! ("White screen" problem because of obsolete EDGE Webcontrol) 
- Precompiled WebRTC libs deleted for repo size optimization (locate them at original https://github.com/WinAppCommunity/Quarrel/tree/insider and use them for compilation success).
- My some refactoring violated on app build... no success for Quarrel project, some UAP 19041 bugs.. ;( 

## Status
- Early bird. PoC. Login-Password auth mode still broken.
- Discord token change Dialog implemented. 
- Solution optimization (project refactoring) provided (Advertising & App Center Telemetry cut-off).

## Reference(s)

## .
As is. No support. RnD only. DIY.
